Common utility actors built with [Ractor](https://github.com/slawlor/ractor)

A pure-Rust actor framework. Inspired from [Erlang's `gen_server`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html), with the speed + performance of Rust!

This crate contains some utility actors for Ractor-based systems. Additionally because `ractor` is built on `tokio`,
you can often intermingle these utility actors with non-actor async workflows.

**This crate is WIP**

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
ractor_actors = "0.4"
```

## What's here?

The following utility actors are defined in this crate (enable with the associated feature in brackets):

1. Filewatcher (feature `filewatcher`) - Watch files and directories for changes. Built with `notify`.
2. Tcp actors (feature `net`) - Listen for incoming connections and handle messages in/out from them as sessions.
3. Cron management actor (feature `time`) - A basic cron-job managing actor, which supports the full cron syntax and will execute operations on a period
4. Stream processing actors (feature `streams`) - Actors for common tasks processing streams, including infinite/finite loops, stream processing, and stream multiplexing.
5. Watchdog process (feature `watchdog`) - A "global" watchdog process, which can be used to terminate actors after some level of inactivity.
